    <h2> One the Pulse of Morning </h2>
    <p>
      By Maya Angelou
    </p>
    <p>
      A Rock, A River, A Tree
      Hosts to species long since departed,
      Marked the mastodon,
      The dinosaur, who left dried tokens
      Of their sojourn here
      On our planet floor,
      Any broad alarm of their hastening doom
      Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages.    </p>
    <p>
      But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,
      Come, you may stand upon my
      Back and face your distant destiny,
      But seek no haven in my shadow,
      I will give you no hiding place down here.    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- This line is important to me because it shows how far humanity has come
      but are still embracing the darkness with our violence and greed and if we
      do not stop it and it will come to haunt us later and the rock (nature) will give us not shelter
     -->
    <em>
      You, created only a little lower than
      The angels, have crouched too long in
      The bruising darkness
      Have lain too long
      Facedown in ignorance,
      Your mouths spilling words
      Armed for slaughter.   </em> </p>
    <p>
      The Rock cries out to us today,
      You may stand upon me,
      But do not hide your face.    </p>
